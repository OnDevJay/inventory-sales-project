Project Brief: Inventory and Sales Management Database

1. AIM

The goal of this project was to build a functional and easy-to-use database to help manage inventory and sales data efficiently. By keeping track of stock levels across different warehouses and recording product sales, the database provides useful insights for managing inventory and improving sales performance. The underlying idea is that a well-structured database can simplify inventory control and offer a clearer view of sales trends, helping businesses make smarter decisions.


2. KEY STAKEHOLDERS

Inventory Managers: They rely on up-to-date stock information to prevent shortages and overstocking.

Sales Teams: Use the sales data to identify top-selling products and track sales performance over time.

Business Analysts: They need accurate data to generate reports and insights that influence business decisions.

Database Administrators: Responsible for managing the database, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing performance.


3. PROCESS

Database Design:

I designed the database to have three main tables: Products, Inventory, and Sales, ensuring that all relevant data could be easily tracked and managed.

Data Insertion:

Populated the database with sample data to simulate a real-world scenario, adding details for products, stock levels in different warehouses, and recorded sales.

Query Development:

Wrote SQL queries to answer common business questions, such as:

What products are running low on stock?

What are the total sales and revenue for each product?

Which products are best-sellers in each category?

How do sales trends vary month to month?

Optimizing Performance:

As the database grew, I optimized queries and added indexes to ensure the system ran smoothly and efficiently.


4. FINDINGS

The database worked as expected, delivering helpful insights:

It allows managers to quickly identify products with low stock and make restocking decisions.

Sales data was easily accessible, giving a clear picture of which products were performing best.

The system could also track monthly sales trends, providing useful data for long-term sales strategies.


5. CHALLENGES

Database Design: One of the challenges was making sure the tables were structured in a way that avoided redundancy and maintained data integrity, which required careful planning.

Query Performance: As more data was added, query performance started to slow down. I addressed this by optimizing queries and adding indexes to speed things up.

Data Integrity: Ensuring data was accurate and consistent across the tables required careful attention to relationships and constraints, which was a key focus throughout the project.
